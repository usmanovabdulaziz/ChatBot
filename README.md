# Gemini Telegram Bot

## Description
This project is a Python-based Telegram bot that integrates with Google Generative AI to provide intelligent responses to user messages. It leverages the power of the Gemini 1.5 Flash model to generate human-like text replies in real-time, making it a versatile tool for conversational automation.

## Features
- Real-time message handling via Telegram.
- Integration with Google Generative AI for smart, context-aware responses.
- Configurable via environment variables for secure API key management.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/usmanovabdulaziz/ChatBot.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd chat_bot
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Run the bot:
   ```
   python gemini.py
   ```

## Usage
1. Start the bot by running the script as shown above.
2. Open Telegram and search for your bot using its username (configured via your Telegram API key).
3. Send a message to the bot, and it will respond with a generated reply from the Gemini AI model.

Example interaction:
- User: "What is the weather like today?"
- Bot: [AI-generated response based on the prompt]

## Configuration
The bot requires API keys for Telegram and Google Generative AI. Configure these using a `.env` file:

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```
   TELEGRAM_API_KEY=your_telegram_bot_api_key
   GEMINAI_API_KEY=your_google_generative_ai_key
   ```
2. Replace `your_telegram_bot_api_key` with the token provided by BotFather on Telegram.
3. Replace `your_google_generative_ai_key` with your Google Generative AI API key.

The `.env` file is loaded automatically when you run `gemini.py`.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- `pyTelegramBotAPI` - For Telegram bot functionality.
- `google-generativeai` - For interacting with Googleâ€™s Generative AI API.
- `python-dotenv` - For loading environment variables from `.env`.
